## Face Analizer
Deep learning based face recognition, face detection, emotion recognition

When we think about some particular person, very often we imagines his or her face, smile and different unique facial features.
We know how to recognize the person by it's face, understand his emotions, estimate his age, almost with 100% certainly tell his gender.
Human vision system can do these and many other things with faces very easily.
Can we do the same with modern artificial intelligence alghorithms, in particular, deep neural networks?
